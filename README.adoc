All the ledger's a stage, and the accounts in it merely players; +
They have their exits and their entrances +
Though the Accountant calls them debits and credits. +
Money in transaction plays two acts, the first its addition, +
The second its complete negation. In bookkeeping, +
The double entry of a moment, at least two postings, must be made: +
Where money is privy to our deeds and misdeeds; +
Where usurers compound their interests with green eyeshade; +
Where Mammon whispers our avarice into larceny; +
Where post-capitalism derives chimerical things +
To sell and depreciate, to buy for dividends; +
Hoarding our leverage and leveraging our hoard, +
The budgeting, the bonds, the securities and derivatives accounted +
Until the balance of both creed and debt has been recorded +
And the accounts are settled.
