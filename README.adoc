All the ledger's a stage, and the accounts in it merely players; +
They have their exits and their entrances +
Though the Accountants call them debits and credits. +
Money in transaction plays two acts, the first its addition, +
The second its complete negation. In bookkeeping, +
A double entry of a moment and many postings must be made, +
Where money anonymizes our chiefs and mischiefs +
Where usurers compound their interests with green eyeshade, +
Where Mammon whispers our avarice into complicity, +
Where post-capitalism derives chimerical things +
To advertise, exhorting us to sell and buy +
Where the economy drops the have nots into a crouch, +
And the have somes with a bubble precarity about them, +
And the have-mosts helicoptering from one pillar to another, +
Hoarding their leverage and leveraging their hoard, +
The budgeting, the passion, and the syllables counted +
Until the balance of both creed and debt has been recorded all +
And the accounts are settled.
