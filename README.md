Now to confabulate these broken pieces into a story of money.

All the ledger's a stage, and the accounts in it merely players; They have their
exits (or debits) and their entrances (or credits).  And money in transaction
plays two acts, the first its addition, The second its complete negation. In
keeping of the book, An entry of a moment and many postings may be made Until
the balance of both creed and debt has been recorded And the accounts are
settled.
