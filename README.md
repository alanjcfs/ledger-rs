All the ledger's a stage, and the accounts in it merely players;<br>
They have their exits (or debits) and their entrances (or credits).<br>
And money in transaction plays two acts, the first its addition,<br>
The second its complete negation. In keeping of the book,<br>
An entry of a moment and many postings may be made<br>
Until the balance of both creed and debt has been recorded<br>
And the accounts are settled
